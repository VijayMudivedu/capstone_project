```
### Footnote Variable: 
Below Footnote levels do not contribute to score, or the denominator (Total Complications) for any of the hospitals. These rows can be removed from analysis.
1 - the number of cases/patients is too few to report.                                                                                                3464      NaN            0
13 - results cannot be calculated for this reporting period.                                                                                         13090      NaN            0
19 - data are shown only for hospitals that participate in the inpatient quality reporting (iqr) and outpatient quality reporting (oqr) programs.     1793      NaN            0
4 - data suppressed by cms for one or more quarters.                                                                                                   548      NaN            0
5 - results are not available for this reporting period.                                                                                              1950      NaN            0
7 - no cases met the criteria for this measure.                                                                                                       1029      NaN            0

- analysing the NAs in the denominator and reason for NAs in the Total Number of Admissions (Denominator) variable.

```{r}
# which variable is contributing most NAs  in "Denominator" variable?
complications_df_cleaned_footnote_nas %>% group_by(Compared.to.National) %>% 
  summarise(cnt_rws = n(), Avg_denom = mean(Denominator,na.rm = T),Sum_Denom = sum(Denominator,na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(cnt_rws))

complications_df_cleaned_footnote_nas[is.na(complications_df_cleaned_footnote_nas$Denominator),] %>% summary()

```
- NAs in the Denominator (Total number of people admitted to hospital is unknown) are due to "Serious complications/ PSI_90_Safety". Lower estimate, Higher Estimate, Scores have even distribution. Removing this data wouldn't impact the overall ddistribution of the data

```{r}
complications_df_cleaned_footnote_nas_denom <-  complications_df_cleaned_footnote_nas[!is.na(complications_df_cleaned_footnote_nas$Denominator),] #%>% summary()
# verification of scores and denominators before and imputations of of NAs

summary(complications_df_cleaned_footnote_nas)
summary(complications_df_cleaned)

```


```{r}

#How is the distrbituion of measures before and after removing the footnote NAs, Cleaning up the denominators of NAs
complications_df_cleaned %>% group_by(Measure.ID) %>% summarise(cnt_rws = n(),avg_scr = mean(Score,na.rm = T),avg_denom = mean(Denominator,na.rm = T)) %>% arrange(desc(avg_scr))
complications_df_cleaned_footnote_nas %>% group_by(Measure.ID) %>% summarise(cnt_rws = n(),avg_scr = mean(Score),avg_denom = mean(Denominator,na.rm = T)) %>% arrange(desc(avg_scr))
complications_df_cleaned_footnote_nas_denom %>% group_by(Measure.ID) %>% summarise(cnt_rws = n(),avg_scr = mean(Score),avg_denom = mean(Denominator)) %>% arrange(desc(avg_scr))

```
- Large average scores and low denominators are due to "PSI_4_SURG_COMP: Deaths among patients with serious treatable Complications after surgery"" 
- PSI_90_SAFETY: has no denominator score as this measure is calculated from PSI 03,06, The CMS PSI 90 is calculated from PSIs 03, 06, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.
and low average score. Hence doesn't fit well into the scoring needs.
- PSI_4_SURG_COMP: induces low extreme outliers in "Denominator" variable and high extremes in "Scores" Variable

### outlier scoring data

```{r}
# distribution of outliers

ggplot(data = complications_df_cleaned_footnote_nas_denom,aes(x = Score,y = Denominator,col = Measure.ID)) + 
  geom_point(position = position_jitter()) + 
  facet_wrap(facets = ~ Measure.ID,scales = "free") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.background = element_blank())
  #theme(legend.position = c(0.8,0.6), legend.background = element_blank())


```
* Clearly, the above plot shows that data is distribeted into two chunks with a clear separation. Value scores above 100, SURG COMP and value scores below 25 for the rest measure IDs
* High Scores with Least Low "Denominators" in PSI_4_SURG_COMP is an outlier amoung the available set of variable levels.

```

- From the 96th percentile onwards the value of variable have started to increase steeply and outliers are identified around this percentile

```{r}
#steady increase in the value except the last quantile last 10% of quantile values are abrupt
quantile(complications_df$Score,probs =  seq(0, 1, 0.01),na.rm = T ) #abrupt increase in the quantile score about 94%.
plot(quantile(complications_df$Score,probs =  seq(0, 1, 0.01),na.rm = T )) #abrupt increase in the quantile score about 94%.

```

- A central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) is a serious infection that occurs when germs (usually bacteria or viruses) enter the bloodstream through the central line. Healthcare providers must follow a strict protocol when inserting the line to make sure the line remains sterile and a CLABSI does not occur. In addition to inserting the central line properly, healthcare providers must use stringent infection control practices each time they check the line or change the dressing. Patients who get a CLABSI have a fever, and might also have red skin and soreness around the central line. If this happens, healthcare providers can do tests to learn if there is an infection present.

-Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a bacteria that causes diarrhea and can lead to serious complications. Those at highest risk for C. difficile infection include people who take antibiotics and also receive care in any medical setting, including hospitals. C. difficile bacteria produce spores that can be spread from patient to patient. Symptoms from C. diff infections often take a few days to develop. Patients are tested for C. diff. infections if they show signs of illness while in the hospital. This measure compares the number of stool specimens that tested positive for C. diff toxin four or more days after the patient entered the hospital to a national benchmark.

- CAUTI -Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infections: A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection involving any part of the urinary system, including urethra, bladder, ureters, and kidney. UTIs are the most common type of healthcare-associated infection reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).  Among UTIs acquired in the hospital, approximately 75% are associated with a urinary catheter, which is a tube inserted into the bladder through the urethra to drain urine.  Between 15-25% of hospitalized patients receive urinary catheters during their hospital stay.  The most important risk factor for developing a catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI) is prolonged use of the urinary catheter.  Therefore, catheters should only be used for appropriate indications and should be removed as soon as they are no longer needed.


- Considering the SIRs, that Centre for Diesease Control and Prevention uses to calculate. Standard Infection Ration (SIR) which takes into account patient care location, number of patients with an exisiting infection, lab mehtords, hed size, afficialiton with a medical schools, bed size of the hospital, age of patients.

- central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), catheter- associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), surgical site infection (SSI) from colon surgery or abdominal hysterectomy, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) blood laboratory-identified events (bloodstream infections), and Clostridium difficile (C.diff.) laboratory-identified events (intestinal infections). The HAI measures show how often patients in a particular hospital contract certain infections during the couse of their medical treatment

HAI_1_SIR, HAI_1a_SIR, HAI_2_SIR, HAI_2a_SIR, HAI_6_SIR,HAI_4_SIR, HAI_5_SIR, HAI_3_SIR

HAI-1 measure tracks central-line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) in ICUs and select wards. 
HAI-1a measure tracks central-line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) in ICUs. The HAI-1 measure will be phased in over the next year to replace the HAI-1a measure.
HAI-2 measure tracks catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) in ICUs and select wards. 
The HAI-2a measure only tracks catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) in ICUs. 
The HAI-2 measure will be phased in over the next year to replace the HAI-2a measure.

#-------------------------
#-Data preparation
#--------------------

Different things to be checked
1. Check if there are any duplicate measures
2. check outliers in the measures
3. Remove unwanted rows/columns
4. imputing missing values
5. convert all characters to lower case
6. check for invalid characters

Numeric variables in complications dataframe are:

```{r}
# Remove unwanted Rows

```



```{r}

zcomp <- sapply(complications_df,class)
int_comp_var <- which(zcomp %in% c("integer",'numeric'))
char_comp_var <- which(zcomp %in% c("factor"))

complications_df[char_comp_var] <- sapply(complications_df[char_comp_var], tolower)
head(complications_df)
```


```{r}
#missing value imputation
sapply(complications_df,function(x) sum(is.na(x))) # distribution of NAs
```
There are significant number of NAs in the dataset in Score, Lower Estimate, Higher Estimate.
Calculating the percentage of NAs in Compared to National Average
FootNote variable has 59% of data as NAs and hence unusable for analysis. 





```{r}
# NA Analysis and checking the correlation of other variables with Compared to National.

sapply(complications_df[is.na(complications_df$Compared.to.National),],summary)
library(mice)
library(psych)
pairs.panels(x = complications_df[int_comp_var],scale = T,ellipses = T,pch = 20,method = 'pearson',cor = T)
      
```
### Comments: Removing the NAs impacts the the  score. There are 18410 


```{r}
# NA analaysis of the other variables
sapply(complications_df[!is.na(complications_df$Score),],summary)

```

```{r}
#check the correlation between the variables score, denominiator, lower estimate, higher estimate
cor(complications_df[int_comp_var],use = 'complete.obs')
```
#### There is a strong correlation between score, lower.estimate, higher.estimate, negative correlation between the score, Lower.estimate





```{r}
# to lower

```

```{r}
# remove unwanted columns

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
